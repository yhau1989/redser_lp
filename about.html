            <p>RESDEC is a prototype recommendation tool that provides real time assistance in selecting implementation components to configure
            product features pertaining to a SPL domain. It is designed to offer support and assistance to stakeholders with or without
            information associated with the userâ€™s profile.</p>
            <p>This recommendation process has two stages: 1) For stakeholders configuring a new product, RESDEC provides automatic recommendations
            based on trends of which implementation components are best ranked and most used within the community, 2) For stakeholders
            with prior experience, RESDEC provides a list of implementation component recommendations based on both user profiles that
            have used similar components and the features associated with the implementation components.</p>
            <p>To make recommendations, RESDEC requires stakeholders to specify as requirements which implementation components have been
            used in past configurations or, when applicable, the features associated with the implementation components, which will help
            RESDEC apply filters that improve the recommendations.</p>
