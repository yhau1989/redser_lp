            <p>
                <b>RESDEC</b> is a web tool designed in Phyton that provides recommendation algorithms based on collaborative filtering and content
            filtering to help stakeholders select implementation components in configuring products in a SPL as defined in three scenarios:</p>
            <p>
                <b>Cold Start</b>: The first scenario occurs when a user wants to know which implementation components could be used to configure
                a new product in a SPL domain. In other words, the user is starting to build a product from zero and therefore does not have
                profile information. As a result, the system identifies it as a cold start and suggests the implementation components most
                used and best rated among the community of users. In Wordpress, for example, let’s consider a new user, or a user without
                experience, who wants to configure a website. In this case, the system will recommend a list of plugins (implementation components)
                according to which plugins are most popular or best rated by Wordpress users.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Transition components based on ratings</b>: The second scenario occurs when a users has previous experience in implementing
                components to configure a product in a SPL domain and, based on this experience, needs to improve or develop the product.
                Note that in this case, the user already has profile information, so the recommendations are done starting with the user’s
                historical information and the experiences of similar profiles within the community.

            </p>
            <p>
                In Wordpress, for example, the system considers users’ ratings of plugins used in developing personalized websites. This
                information allows the system to search for other plugins similar to those installed that also could be used to supplement
                the site or offer a good substitute to the plugins currently in use.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Transition components based on features</b>: The third scenario, similar to the previous one, occurs when a user has prior experience
                implementing components to configure a product in a SPL domain. The difference from the previous scenario is that here the
                recommendations are made considering the content associated with the implementation components, that is, descriptive information
                that enables improved recommendations. Specifically, we use the features of the implementation components associated with
                the user’s profile.

            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of Wordpress, for example, we use tags associated with plugins (component features), with which the system will
                recommend which plugin tags are most similar to the plugin tags selected by the user.
            </p>

            <p>
                 RESDEC Tool has 3 components: a repository manager, a recommender manager, and an output manager.
            </p>

            <p>

            </p>
                
    
            <p><b>The repository manager</b> responds to stakeholder requests and structure DBKnowledge through CSVs. For the dataset we present
            together with this tool, we used data extracted from Wordpress.</p>
            <p>The <b>recommender manager</b> is in charge of processing recommendations based on the three RESDEC scenarios we outlined. It is
            developed in Phyton with a library package that contains the algorithms the recommender manager carries out according to
            the scenario the stakeholder selects.</p>
            <p>For the <b>Cold Start</b> scenario, RESDEC uses a classic popularity algorithm, while for algorithms executed in the <b> Transition
            between implementation components based on ratings</b> scenario, it uses Scikit-surprise libraries, and for the <b>Transition between
            implementation components based on features</b>, it uses the Scikit-learn library.
            </p>
            <p>The recommender manager was designed to be scalable over time. In other words, it provides the ability to extend RESDEC’s
            benefits by enabling it to tailor new similarity metrics and new recommendation algorithms for each one of the scenarios
            that a stakeholder could face.</p>
            <p>The <b>output manager</b> interacts directly with the stakeholder using the repository manager and the recommendation manager to
            create a list of implementation component suggestions. It is designed in HTML5 and JavaScript and supported with the Semantic
            UI interface design framework. Stakeholders interact with RESDEC through a web navigator at <a href="http://www.resdec.com">http://www.resdec.com</a> .</p>
            <p>In general, the output manager is responsible for receiving stakeholder requests and communicating the requirements to the
            recommender manager in order for it to carry out the suitable algorithm with the information the repository manager provides,
            finally displaying on screen the recommendations it generates.</p>
